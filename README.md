A simple quiz game to test your front end development knowledge. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Download the code and run the ```index.html``` file in your favourite browser.

Good luck and have fun.

## Future Implementations

~~A countdown timer to start when the user clicks the start button.~~

~~Darkmode.~~

Seperation of concerns. Need to seperate the questions from the code.

## Issues

No known issues.

Media queries for medium and larger screens still needs to be coded.
